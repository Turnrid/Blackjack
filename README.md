# Blackjack Game

This is a fun command line, python blackjack game that 1 to 5 players can play against each other and an AI. The program will keep track of players bets and running totals
and then deal out cards and ask the current player if they would like to hit or hold. It keeps track if the value's exceed 21 and tells the player if they busted out.

After all players the AI takes its turn and a winner or tie will be decided. It will then prompt you if you would like to play again.
